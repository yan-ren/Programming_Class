The relationships in a tree are hierarchical
Tree definition
A tree is an ADT that stores elements hierarchically

General tree
- tree has nodes to store value, nodes have parent-child relationship
- each node, except for the root node, has one parent and zero or more children

Binary tree
- every node has at most two children
- each child node is labeled as either a left child or right child

Binary search tree
- the value stored in left child is smaller than the value stored in the node
- the value stored in right child is bigger than the value stored in the node

How to construct a BST

def find_disappeared_numbers(nums):

'''
write a recursive function that reverse a string
'''
base case: when function stop calling itself
recursive case: when function calls itself

'abc' -> 'cba'

if string has length 1:
    return string

reverse('abc')
reverse('bc') + 'a'
reverse('c') + 'b'
reverse('c') -> base case

'''
write a recursive function that calculate the factorial of n
'''
4! = 4*3*2*1
3! = 3*2*1
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        return factorial(n-1) * n


tree:
A tree is an abstract data strcutrue that stores elements hierarchically
each element in tree has parent child relationship.

General tree:
we define a tree as a set of nodes storing elemtns such that nodes have a parent-child relationship

Binary tree:
Binary tree is a general tree with following:
each node can have at most two children

Binary search tree:
bianry search tree is a binary tree with following properties:
- value in the left child node is less that current node
- value in the right child node is bigger that current node
