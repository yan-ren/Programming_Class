From past CCC questions and leetcode

- if question involves iterating through the graph, explore, visiting -> graph traversal -> BFS/DFS

Leetcode 130
1. find all unflippable node, e.g. all 'O' node on the boarder

2. find all other 'O' node that is connected to unflippable 'O' nodes, which means they can not be flipped either.

3. flip the remaining 'O' to 'X'

Approach 1. DFS: stack or recursion

Approach 2. BFS: queue

General guideline to help you decide when to use DFS versus BFS

Use BFS when:
1. shortest path in unweighted graph, since BFS explores all neighbors at current depth before moving to next depth, it guarantees finding the shortest path.

2. Level-by level traversal, also in tree structures

3. Connected component in unweighted graph

Use DFS when:
1. Exploring all paths, DFS goes as deep as possible along each path before backtracking, making it suitable for tasks like finding all possible solution

2. Topological Sort in DAG

3. Cycle Detection

4. Connected component in directed graph

Time complexity

Both DFS and BFS runs in O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges
