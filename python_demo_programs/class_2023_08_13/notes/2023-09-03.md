#### Question
Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.

Common idea:
Use list, loop through each value, put the value in the list
and use sum() / K

time complexity: since for every element of the input list, we calculate the sum of its next 'K' elements, the time complexity of above will be O(N*K), if K ~ N, we may have worst run time O(N^2)
