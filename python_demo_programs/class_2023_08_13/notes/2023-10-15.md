## Two pointers

When to use it?

Sorted array/list and need to find out set of elements that satisfies certain conditions

For example:

Given a list of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the list whose sum is equal to the given target.

Basic solution

loop through each element one by one and loop through the remaining elements to find a pair 
with the given sum. Time complexity of this algorithm will be O(N^2)

After class practice: write the two pointer solution for above problem

Exercise:

Given an array of sorted numbers, remove all duplicate from it. (using two pointer approach, O(N))

## Binary Search Tree
Binary search tree is a binary tree with two additional properties:
- Keys sorted in the left subtree are less than its parent
- Keys sorted in the right subtree are greater than its parent

#### Insertion
Insert algorithm:
start with root, if new value is bigger than the root, go to the right child of root. Otherwise,
go to the left child of root. Repeat the comparison until there is an empty to add the new value.

#### Search
Algorithm TreeSearch(node, key):
    if key == node.key then
        return True
    else if key < node.key and node.left is not empty then
        return TreeSearch(node.left, key)
    else
        return TreeSearch(node.right, key)


#### Delete
- If the delete node contains one child
- If the delete node contains two children
