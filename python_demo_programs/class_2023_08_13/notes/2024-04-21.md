## Topological Sort - directed graph

Many real world situation can be modelled asa directed graph where some event must occur before other

A topological ordering is an ordering of nodes where for each directed edges from node A to B, node A appears before node B

question: is topological order unique?

no, may have multiple topological order, where all node in topological order follows the edge direction

question: the graph that you can find topological order needs to be a directed graph, but there is another property?

Topological order only exists in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

To find Topological Order: Topological Sort Algorithm
Pick an unvisited node, beginning with the selected node, do a DFS (Depth First Search) exploring only unvisited node. On the recursive callback of DFS, add current node to the topological ordering in reverse order
