#### Heaps

A heap is a binary tree T that stores the value with two additional properties

1. heap-order property - max heap
In a heap T, for every position p other than the root, the key stored at p is greater than or equal to the key stored at p's parent
If the heap-order property is defined in other way, .e.g. as each node is smaller than its parent, we have a min heap

2. complete binary tree property
A heap T has to be a complete binary tree. Complete binary tree means each level has the max number of nodes and the remaining nodes at the last level is in the leftmost position

When use binary tree, if the tree is inbalanced, all algorithm (insert, delete, searching) will have a worse performance. Then people create variation of binary tree, such as AVL tree, red-black tree, etc. to make binary tree balanced.

One import usage for heap is to use heap to build a priority queue, which is ADT. 
Priority queue is similiary to a regular queue. Each element in priority queue has an associated priority.
