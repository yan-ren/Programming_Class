## Minimum Spanning Tree

In an undirected weighted graph G, finding a tree T such that contains all the vertices in G, and minimizes the sum of
cost of vertices

Prim algorithm
Prim's is a greedy algorithm for MST problem. O(Elog((E))) or O(Elog(V))
1. create a min priority queue that sorts edges base on min edge cost
2. start algorithm on any node S. Mark S as visited and iterate over all edges
of S and adding them to PQ.
3. each time before MST has been formed, take the cheapest edges from QP
4. If the edge is pointing to the node already visited, skip if. Otherwise, mark
the current node as visited and add the selected edge to the MST
5. Iterate over the new current node's edges and add all to the PQ

O(VlogV)

line 115: 2E times

line 117: O(logV)

O(2ElogV) -> ignore the const get O(ElogV)

Overall runtime

O(VlogV) + O(ElogV) ~ O(ElogV)

|E| >= |V|
