## Link-based vs Array-Based sequence
python list, list[0]

#### Advantage of array-based(indexed based) sequence
- Array provide O(1) access to an element based on index

#### Advantage of linked based sequence
- Link-based sturcture support O(1) time insertion and deletion at given position

## General Tree
Nonlinear data structure. Tree also provide a natural organization for data. Real life example, file system, web, etc

#### Formal tree definition
We define a tree T as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship, with following properties:

- If T is nonempty, it has a root node
- Each non-root node has a unique parent 

#### Other node relationships
- Two nodes that are children of the same parent are siblings.
- A node is external if it has no children, external nodes are also known as leaves
- A node is internal if it has one or more children

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a tree with following properties:
- Every node has at most two children
- Each child node is labeled as being either a left child or a right child
- A left child precedes a right child in the order of children of a node

## After class challenge (homework)
Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (sliding window)

Problem statement: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: String="araaci", K=2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".

Example 2:
Input: String="araaci", K=1
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".

Example 3:
Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".
