#### Seven functions commonly used in algorithm analysis

1. constant function, e.g. f(n) = c
2. logirthm function, e.g. f(n) = log(n)
3. linear function, e.g. f(n) = n
4. f(n) = nlogn
5. f(n) = n^2
6. f(n) = n^3
7. summation, f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2

Big-O notation

Let f (n) and g(n) be functions mapping positive integers to positive real numbers.
We say that f (n) is O(g(n)) if there is a real constant c > 0 and an integer constant
n0 ≥ 1 such that
f (n) ≤ cg(n), for n ≥ n0.
