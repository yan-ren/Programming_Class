Vertices and edges

edge weight

path: is a sequences of vertices connected by edges, which allows to move from one vertex to another in the graph

degree: the degree of a vertex in a graph is a measure of the number of edges incident to that vertex

Dijkstra's algorithm

Is for shortest path problem, which means finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph.

Dijkstra's can help to find shortest path from a fixed node to every other node

1. mark all nodes as unvisited
2. assign to all nodes a tentative large distance value
3. for the current node, calculate the distance to all unvisited neighbors
3.1 update shortest distance if new distance is shortest that old distance
4. marked current node as visited
5. choose new current node from unvisited nodes with minimum distance
