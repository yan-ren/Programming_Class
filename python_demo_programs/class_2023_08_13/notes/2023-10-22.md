## Practice
Given an list of unsorted numbers, find all unique triplets in it that add up to zero.

Example 1

Input: [-3, 0, 1, 2, -1, 1, -2]

Output: [-3, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 2], [-2, 1, 1], [-1, 0, 1]

Explanation: There are four unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.

Example 2

Input: [-5, 2, -1, -2, 3]

Output: [[-5, 2, 3], [-2, -1, 3]]

Explanation: There are two unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.

Solution:
This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and have the similar idea as Pair with target sum.

First step, sort the list

Then iterate through each value and during iteration, e.g we are at number 'X', we need to find Y and Z so that X+Y+Z=0. Then the problem is converted to finding a pair whose sum is equal to -X
