Last time, we discuss the linked structure implementation for binary tree, similiar as linked list. Today, we look at an alternative representation of binary tree, which is based on numbering the position (level numbering)

If node p is root, then number(p) = 0

If node p is the left child of node q, then number(p) = 2*number(q) + 1

If node p is the right child of node q, then number(p) = 2*number(q) + 2

We use this relation to represent a binary using a list, where the number for each node is the index inside a list.

Advantage of list/array based representation of binary tree is that a position is represented by a fixed number. The tree operation, e.g. add node, delete node, etc, becomes to simple list operation

Disadvantage, space usage depends on the shape of the tree. List may contains empty space if a node does not exist in the tree. Space will be
