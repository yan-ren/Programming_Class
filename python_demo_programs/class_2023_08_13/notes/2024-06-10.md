## What You Can Do During Summer Break

1. Think about the programming language you want to use in CCC 2025.

If you want to try another language in next year's competition, this summer is a good time to get familiar with it. For example, you could learn C++ or Java. If you don't have a preference, go with C++, as it is more challenging and fun.

#### How to study a new language?

The best way is to quickly look at the basic syntax online and try to use it to solve a few questions. Watching videos is more for beginners, can be slow, and some videos are misleading. I would prefer using the following materials for C++:

2. Keep practicing. For example, do projects you are interested in, solve LeetCode questions, and also solve past CCC Senior 1 and Senior 2 problems.
