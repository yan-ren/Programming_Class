#### Binary Search Tree (continue)
Property:

Minimum value of binary search tree is in the left most node

Maximum value of binary search tree is in the right most node

Traversal

A traveral of a tree is to visit all nodes.

Depth-first traversal
- preorder traversal

In a preorder traversal, the root node is visited first and then the subtrees rooted at its children are traversed recursively.

- inorder traversal

recursively visit left subtree, then visit the root node, then recursively visit right subtree

- postorder traversal

recursively visit left subtree, and right subtree, then visit the root node


Breadth first traversal

Nodes are visited by levels
