Focus: More advanced algorithm/data structure topics

Additional: solve senior questions
## summer break

## mid Aug, class resume

## Today Topic

Priority Queue
- more complex examples

Normal queue arranges the items by FIFO order, priority queue arranges the items by priority.

ADT - can different implementation

In python, two popular ways of using priority queue, both come from python lib
1. heapq - implement base on Heap (special type of binary tree)
2. queue.priorityqueue (OOP style implementation)

Time complexity: *O(log n)* for insertion and extraction

Graph theory/algorithm
- dfs/bfs
- shortest path problem
  - dijkstra's algorithm and example
- minimum spanning tree problem

Dynamic programming
- more examples,
