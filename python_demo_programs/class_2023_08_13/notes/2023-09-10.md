Question:
Given an array of positive numbers and a positive number ‘S’, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to ‘S’. Return 0, if no such subarray exists.
Example 1

Input: [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2], S=7 
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest subarray with a sum great than or equal to '7' is [5, 2].

Solution (sliding window):
1. we add element from the begining of the list until their sum becomes greter than or eaqual to 'S'
2. these values constitute sliding window
3. keep adding one element into the window also try to shrink the window from the beginning. We shrink the windwo unitl the winow's sum is smaller than 'S'. We need to check two things: 1. check if the current windown lenght is the smallest so far. 2. Subtract the first element of the window
