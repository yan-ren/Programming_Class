Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and the both have a list of favorite restaurants
represented by strings

You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is choice tie between answers,
output all of them with no order requirement. You can assume there always exists an answer

example1:
list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"]
list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
output: Shogun

example2:
list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"]
list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
output: Shogun

solution1: basic loop
loop through each value in list1, for each value find the same value'index in list2, calculate the index sum,
compare to get the minimum

solution2: dictionary
convert list to following dictionary
list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"]
{"Shogun": 0, "Tapioca Express": 1, "Burger King": 2, "KFC": 3}

list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
{"KFC": 0, "Shogun": 1, "Burger King": 2}

loop through dictionary1, get the value from dictionary2, sum two values, compare to get the minimum



Given list of positive numbers and a positive number ‘k’, 
find the maximum sum of any contiguous sublist of size ‘k’.

example:
Input: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k=3 
Output: 9
Explanation: sublist with maximum sum is [5, 1, 3].
